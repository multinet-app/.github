## MultiNet

Welcome to the MultiNet project. Our goal is to develop a general purpose multivariate network visualization (MVNV) platform that allows our users to understand their complex network data. Additionally, the platform should be extendable and reusable, to allow our community to develop additional functionality on top of our framework.

This project is a joint research and development effort between the University of Utah and Kitware Inc., funded by the National Science Foundation. 

You can visit our deployment by visiting https://multinet.app.
